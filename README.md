# CheckMate
About the app here...

## Process and Approach
Our group set out to create an app that offers something useful in the area of education. We found the GrammarBot API had a lot of potential as something that would be practical and useful for many students and anyone else needing help double-checking their grammar. We initially were only going to create one page with the interface for the third-party app and then create our own first-party app where you could save previous entries. When we continued thinking and talking about it, we decided to built out our fictional organization and include the grammar checker as one of the services they offer, in addition to using donation to help fund educational opportunity for those in need. From there, we decided to include a landing page, our app page and a donation page, which is where we implemented our first-party API to save the information entered into a form.

## Getting Started & Running Our App
Our final project is deployed and can be found here:
You can clone/download the CheckMate repository onto your machine using this URL: https://github.com/eliaschristina4/hope-hacks.git. Use your command line interface or terminal to move into the repository (e.g., cd hope-hacks). Once there, download the appropriate node packages in the terminal using npm i(nstall). Then, type npm start in the terminal to open the project.
